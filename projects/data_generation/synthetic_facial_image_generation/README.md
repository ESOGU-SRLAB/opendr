# Synthentic Multi-view Facial Image Generation based on Rotate-and-Render: Unsupervised Photorealistic Face Rotation from Single-View Images (CVPR 2020)

[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08124)

We utilize with small modifications  (in order to be easily executed) publicly available code, namely an  un-supervised framework that can synthesize 
photorealistic rotated facial images using as input  a single facial image, or multiple such images (one per person). The key insight of the utilized method is that rotating faces in the 3D space back and forth, 
and re-rendering them to the 2D plane can serve as a strong self-supervision.

* Neural 3D Mesh Renderer (CVPR 2018)
* Rotate-and-Render: Unsupervised Photorealistic Face Rotation from Single-View Images (CVPR 2020)
## Requirements
* Python 3.6 is used. Basic requirements are listed in the 'requirements.txt'.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* Install the [Neural_Renderer](https://github.com/daniilidis-group/neural_renderer) following the instructions.
```
pip3 install neural_renderer_pytorch
```

* Download checkpoint and BFM model from [ckpt_and_bfm.zip](https://cicloud.csd.auth.gr/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/OpenDR/FTP%20Server%20Material/simulation/ckpt_and_bfm.zip) put it in ```3ddfa``` and unzip it. The 3D models are borrowed from [3DDFA](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA). 


## DEMO

1. Download the [checkpoint](https://cicloud.csd.auth.gr/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/OpenDR/FTP%20Server%20Material/simulation/latest_net_G.zip)
and put it in ```./checkpoints/rs_model```.

2.	Execute the one-step OPENDR function 3ddfa/testSyntheticDataGeneration.py specifying the input images  folder, the output folder, the desired degrees (range -90 to 90) for generating the facial images in multiple view angles pitch and yaw  as indicated in the command line: 
```sh
cd 3ddfa

python3 testSyntheticDataGeneration.py
```
3. Results are multi-view facial images for every person identity in a respective folder called  ```results/rs_model/example/```
